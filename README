Databinder Twine
================

This is a sample application for Databinder Dispatch[1], built and packaged
by simple-build-tool[2]. If you've run this from the self extracting installer,
you should have a twine project directory with a `twine` script inside it.

You can run the `twine` script from anywhere; it might be fun to put it on your
executable search path. The script refers fully to the project path in its
classpath, so if you move the project you'll need to regenerate the script by
running `sbt script` in the project directory. Here's what it looks like to
run twine from inside twine/

    ./twine
    # opens browser or prints url to grant access, depending on JVM ability
    ./twine <pin>

    # pass in the PIN that Twitter assigns, without brackets
    ./twine I love to tweet from terminal\!

    # print timeline to stdout and stay open, polling for new tweets
    ./twine
  
    # remove oauth credentials from ~/.twine
    ./twine reset

If you'd like to see how Twine ticks, its Scala X-Ray[3] formatted source
is the best place to start. See: target/classes.sxr/Twine.scala.html

Happy twails.
